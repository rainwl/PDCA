### I.clarify the issue

Issue can be defined by three ways
: - Anything that deviates from the norm
: - the gap between reality and expectation
: - Unmet customer needs

To clarify the issues best,we need to take a good look for issues using our own eyes.

### II.split issues

Split into more detail issues.

Determine the work flow.

Managing and solving a bunch of micro problems all at once is much more effective than trying to solve a big problem
with no direction.

### III.Set goals

Analyze the root causes.

The third step is all about `commitment` and `focus`.

Focus on what is `needed` to complete the project and `how long` it will take to complete.

> Set challenging goals, but within limits.

### IV.Analyze the root causes

Make sure you are considering all potential root causes and dealing with them properly.

### V.develop countermeasure

Once you've identified your root cause, you can use that information to develop countermeasures needed to eliminate the
root cause.

Once you have developed your countermeasures, you can start narrowing them down to the most practical and effective ones
based on your goals.

### VI.Implement countermeasures

> Communication is very important
> {style="note"}

Consider implementing one countermeasure at a time to monitor the effectiveness of each countermeasure.

## Check {collapsible="true"}

### VII.Monitor results and processes

As errors occur and countermeasures fail, you need a system to review and modify them to get the desired results.

You can also determine whether the expected result is the result of a countermeasure action or just a fluke.

### VIII.Normalize

It's time to set the new process as a new standard within the organization.
