### I.clarify the issue

Issue can be defined by three ways
: - Anything that deviates from the norm
: - the gap between reality and expectation
: - Unmet customer needs

To clarify the issues best,we need to take a good look for issues using our own eyes.
> Detail & Practical experience
> {style="note"}

### II.split issues

Split into more detail issues.

Determine the work flow.

Managing and solving a bunch of micro problems all at once is much more effective than trying to solve a big problem
with no direction.

### III.Set goals

Analyze the root causes.

The third step is all about `commitment` and `focus`.

Focus on what is `needed` to complete the project and `how long` it will take to complete.

> Set challenging goals, but within limits.
> {style="note"}

### IV.Analyze the root causes

Make sure you are considering all potential root causes and dealing with them properly.

### V.develop countermeasure

Once you've identified your root cause, you can use that information to develop countermeasures needed to eliminate the
root cause.

Once you have developed your countermeasures, you can start narrowing them down to the most practical and effective ones
based on your goals.

## Do {collapsible="true"}

### VI.Implement countermeasures

> Communication is very important
> {style="note"}

Consider implementing one countermeasure at a time to monitor the effectiveness of each countermeasure.

## Check {collapsible="true"}

### VII.Monitor results and processes

As errors occur and countermeasures fail, you need a system to review and modify them to get the desired results.

You can also determine whether the expected result is the result of a countermeasure action or just a fluke.

### VIII.Normalize

It's time to set the new process as a new standard within the organization.




PID:

学习成本

学习原来原理

结构二轴改三轴,代码需要修改

调试硬件没做完,软件不能调试


ways:

gpt大概了解概念,explain the core of program

from core to understand this things 

and attempt to take a look of code  

and modify the code with gpt

: 证据,详细说明,事实而不是猜测
: 采取了对应措施,解决方案,结果

1.执行效率:任务你安排下去,什么
2.小任务拖延,至少2天,leap,
3.ddl提前,
4.重复确认(所有人看见)
5.团队内信息共享,透明
6.怎么让团队成员看看板,接受你的工作流(逐步接受)
7.自检(团队内自审),建立评审,开会(对齐问题)
8.信息同步
